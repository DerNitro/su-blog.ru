**Hello my friend!**

Working with large data streams and analyzing them, you face a problem
determining the ownership of the file, its source, since 99% of all flows
generate soulless electric machines.

Sometimes it can be difficult to determine where the sasder345asd.txt or
123_HDR-Tas.csv file came from (in fact, this is just a set of letters,
in most cases the file names have a structured name, but this is still hard
to read for a person).

.. TEASER_END

Initially, the solution was a small set of bash scripts for elementary renaming
of files, everything changed when the number of threads increased dramatically.
And a deeper hierarchy of unloading directories appeared, for example:

before

    vendor/filename

became

    region/point_id/data_name/filename

and using scripts didn't help anymore.

As always, python came to the rescue, in a few hours a script was prepared
that coped with this function. After going through several iterations of fixes,
improvements and 2 years of work in production, I am ready to provide this
utility to the public - pySpoolerRenamer_
