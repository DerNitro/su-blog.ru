Colleagues, good afternoon!

Having moved to the position of team leader, I began to conduct interviews more
often. And the problem with personnel in the region is making itself felt.

**There is only one way out - to create a specialist!**

And the main question becomes, is he ready?!
It was decided to make a test task that was sent to potential colleagues.
For verification, a specially broken image of the virtual machine was created.

Restoring this VM answer the following questions:
 - Reset password root
 - Working with fstab
 - Iptables|firewalld
 - Routing linux
 - systemd
 - LVM
 - Extended file attributes
 - Recovery of work PostgreSQL
 - Recovery of work bash scripts.

 - `Google <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MCMFml3RkL8MaUBvhBuM8JrCSUNc2h96/view?usp=sharing>`_

Next plans, i will create one more VM for advanced admins.
Bye, bye.
